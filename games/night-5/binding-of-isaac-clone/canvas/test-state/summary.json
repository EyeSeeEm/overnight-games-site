  "notes": "Iteration 3 findings: (1) Test runner stays on title screen until firing triggers game start - wasted ~5s. (2) Player died 2x in ~13s total gameplay (6HP->0HP rapidly) - enemies very aggressive or i-frames not working. (3) Zero kills after entire 20s test (totalKills: 0) - test runner never actually fires at enemies. (4) Movement pattern is repetitive WASD cycle, not strategic. (5) Final state shows boss_monstro in START room - boss should not spawn in start room.",
  "observed_issues": [
    "Title screen: game only starts on fire action, not Enter key despite console log claiming Enter pressed",
    "Combat balance: Player takes damage every ~1-2 seconds, loses all 6HP in about 4-5 seconds of combat",
    "Boss spawn: boss_monstro spawning in room 4,3 (start room) - should only spawn in boss room",
    "Test runner: Never fires at enemies during combat, only fires to accidentally start game"
